- **Data Accuracy**: Validate all data files against Ruby gem and official sources
- **Concurrent Safety**: Implement and test synchronization early in development

### Project Risks

- **Scope Creep**: Maintain strict focus on Ruby gem feature parity
- **Timeline Delays**: Build buffer time into each phase
- **Quality Issues**: Implement continuous testing and code review
- **Documentation Gaps**: Write documentation alongside code development
