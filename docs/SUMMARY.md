# CLLI Go Package - Project Summary

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive Go package that duplicates the functionality of the Ruby gem `steventwheeler/clli` for parsing and working with CLLI (Common Language Location Identifier) codes used in telecommunications.

## Documentation Created

1. **[SPECIFICATIONS.md](SPECIFICATIONS.md)** - Technical specifications and API design
2. **[API.md](API.md)** - Complete API documentation with examples  
3. **[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)** - Implementation architecture and design decisions
4. **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** - Development roadmap with phases and timeline
5. **[../README.md](../README.md)** - Project overview and quick start guide

## Key Features Specified

### Core Functionality

- Parse CLLI strings into components (place, region, network site, entity code)
- Support entity CLLIs, non-building locations, and customer locations
- Strict and relaxed parsing modes with comprehensive validation
- Pattern matching based on Bell System Practices Section 795-100-100

### Geographic Resolution

- Convert CLLI region codes to ISO 3166 country/state codes
- Resolve city names from place codes and region combinations  
- Support for US and Canadian locations with full name resolution

### Entity and Location Types

- Resolve entity codes to equipment type descriptions
- Support switching entities (Tables B-E) and non-switching entities
- Location type identification for specialized location codes

### Performance Requirements

- Sub-millisecond parsing for typical CLLIs
- Thread-safe concurrent access
- Minimal memory footprint (<200 bytes per instance)
- Lazy loading of data files with caching

```

## Development Phases

1. **Foundation** (2 weeks) - Core parsing and pattern matching
2. **Validation** (2 weeks) - Complete validation system
3. **Geographic** (2 weeks) - Geographic information resolution  
4. **Entity Types** (2 weeks) - Entity and location type resolution
5. **Performance** (2 weeks) - Optimization and concurrent safety
6. **Testing** (2 weeks) - Comprehensive testing and QA
7. **Documentation** (2 weeks) - Complete documentation and examples
8. **Release** (Ongoing) - Release management and maintenance

## Next Steps

To begin implementation:

1. Initialize Go module and project structure
2. Implement core CLLI struct and basic parsing
3. Create pattern matching system for entity codes
4. Add comprehensive validation and error handling
5. Implement geographic and entity type resolution
6. Optimize performance and ensure thread safety
7. Create comprehensive test suite and documentation

The specifications and design are now complete and ready for implementation. The project provides a clear roadmap from initial development through stable release with comprehensive functionality that matches and extends the original Ruby gem.
